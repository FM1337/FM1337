Hi there, I'm Allen and this is my GitHub profile, where you'll find some of the open source projects I have worked on and contributed to.

I am a previous owner (and web developer/master) of FlagBrew (though now retired from the team) and also the creator of the Crystal Clear Injector Site and co-creator of the Crystal Clear Trading System.

Software development is my hobby, passion and profession, always willing to help out where I can! ðŸ˜„
